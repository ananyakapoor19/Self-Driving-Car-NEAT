# Neat Cars

## üìù Description

Neat cars allows you to draw a track, choose a starting point and watch the magic happen: the cars will drive themselves and constantly improve their driving skills.
<br>You will also be able to observe the Artificial Neural Network of the best car from the generation.

The project is based on a genetic algorithm called [NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroevolution_of_augmenting_topologies).

### Track 2: Without sensors - Finite track

## üí° How to use

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.7.0+

Get a copy of the Project. Assuming you have git installed, open your Terminal and enter:

```bash
git clone 'https://github.com/marcpinet/neat-cars.git'
```

To install all needed requirements run the following command in the project directory:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running

After that, you can proceed to start the program by running `main.py`.

### Controls and tweaks

Instructions are displayed in the window's title.

You can also see the stats of the current generation in the title...

![title2](readme-data/title2.png)

...and the full stats inside the console.

![cli_output](readme-data/cli_output.png)

Feel free to tweak the parameters inside the `ai/config.txt` but also the static variables inside the `Car`, `CarAI` and `Engine` classes.
For example, you can disable the rendering of the car's sensors by setting `DRAW_SENSORS` to `False` in the `Car` class.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How the AI works

The neural network is trained using the NEAT algorithm. The NEAT algorithm is a genetic algorithm which evolves over time from a basic neural network to a more advanced and complex one *depending on your fitness function* by going further and further. Check the [neat-python documentation](https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/neat_overview.html) for more infos.

Also, you can find the full mathematic approach and details directly in the [NEAT paper](https://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf).

### Inputs

The main informations the car will use to drive are the distance to the walls in front and next of it. The car has 5 sensors :

- In front,
- 2 in the diagonals
- 2 on each side

The sensors are represented by a green line in the rendering. Red means the sensor is detecting a wall.

### Outputs

The outputs are obviously the car's actions. The car has 4 possible actions:

- Turn left
- Turn right
- Accelerate
- Brake

Note that we have a minimum speed to respect so that the car doesn't stop completely nor drives too slowly.

We get, as a starting point for our neural network, something like this:

![nn](readme-data/neat_cars_init.png)

The algorithm will then create itself the necessary connections (increasing their weight over time) and eventually add hidden layers in the process.

### Fitness

The fitness is quite simple: the more the car drives, the better it is. The fitness is calculated by the distance the car has driven. The car is therefore penalized if it crashes.
