## Self-Driving-Car-NEAT
This project aims to train a simulated self-driving car to navigate through custom  tracks designed in Pygame using the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting  Topologies) algorithm. The NEAT algorithm is a type of genetic algorithm that  evolves neural networks to perform a specific task, in this case, driving the car  through the track. 


# Scope of the Project
The scope of the project is to develop a self-driving car simulation using the NEAT algorithm, which will enable the car to navigate through custom tracks created in Pygame. The project includes the following points:
1. Understanding the NEAT algorithm: a. Study the principles and working of the NEAT algorithm, which is a genetic algorithm that evolves neural networks to perform a task. b. Understand how the NEAT algorithm can be used to develop self-driving cars.
2. Developing the simulation environment: a. Create a simulation environment using Pygame that includes a car and a custom track. b. Incorporate sensors into the car to detect the environment and make decisions about its movements. c. Implement a fitness function to evaluate the car's performance.
3. Training the self-driving car: a. Train the car using the NEAT algorithm to navigate through the track. b. Evaluate the car's performance on each track and use the NEAT algorithm to evolve the neural network until optimal performance is achieved. c. Analyze the performance of the car and the neural network.
4. Customizing the tracks: a. Develop multiple custom tracks to test the car's abilities in different scenarios. b. Explore the impact of different track configurations on the car's performance.
5. Further development: a. Explore the possibility of incorporating other machine learning algorithms to enhance the performance of the car. b. Investigate the potential of applying the simulation to real-world self-driving car technology.
