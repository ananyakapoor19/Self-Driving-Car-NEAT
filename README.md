# Self-Driving-Car-NEAT
This project aims to train a simulated self-driving car to navigate through custom  tracks designed in Pygame using the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting  Topologies) algorithm. The NEAT algorithm is a type of genetic algorithm that  evolves neural networks to perform a specific task, in this case, driving the car  through the track.
